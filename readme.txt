Live Mobile Phone News Ticker dynamically shows the ticker of latest mobile phone related news.   

== Description ==

The Live Mobile Phone News Ticker uses RSS feeds from a variety of sources to offer an embeddable stream of the latest cell phone news - as it happens - directly to your site.

The feed is fetched for every view, so users are guaranteed the latest mobile news and information. Clicking on a news headline will take users directly to the relevant article, at the respective site.

A mouse hover over a headline shows a snippet of each post, and the plug-in automatically customizes the styling and font to remain in keeping with your site.

The Live Mobile Phone News Ticker displays feeds in a random order, enabling a mix of news from numerous sources, and the plug-in width adjustable to fit in a range of site sidebars.

The Ticker is completely customizable, with the WP Admin able to:

*	select the number of sites to stream news
*	select the number of headlines visible
*	change the title text
*	change background and text colour
*	adjust scroll speed and interval
*	select whether links opened in a new window/tab.
*	whether links are ‘follow’ or not.
